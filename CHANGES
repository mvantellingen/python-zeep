2.1.1 (2017-06-11)
------------------
 - Fix previous release, it contained an incorrect dependency (Mock 2.1.) due
   to bumpversion :-(


2.1.0 (2017-06-11)
------------------
 - Fix recursion error while creating the signature for a global element when
   it references itself (via ref attribute).
 - Update Client.create_message() to apply plugins and wsse (#465)
 - Fix handling unknown xsi types when parsing elements using xsd:anyType (#455)


2.0.0 (2017-05-22)
------------------

This is a major release, and contains a number of backwards incompatible
changes to the API.

 - Default values of optional elements are not set by default anymore (#423)
 - Refactor the implementation of wsdl:arrayType too make the API more
   pythonic (backwards incompatible).
 - The call signature for Client.create_message() was changed. It now requires
   the service argument:

     ``Client.create_message(service, operation_name, *args, **kwargs)``

 - Choice elements now only work with keyword arguments and raise an exception
   if positional arguments are passed (#439)
 - Implement initial multiref support for SOAP RPC (#326). This was done using
   really good real-world tests from vstoykov (thanks!)
 - Fix exception on empty SOAP response (#442)
 - Fix XSD default values for boolean types (Bartek Wójcicki, #386)


1.6.0 (2017-04-27)
------------------
 - Implement ValueObject.__json__ for json serialization (#258)

 - Handle wsdl errors more gracefully by disabling the invalid operations
   instead of raising an exception (#407, #387)


1.4.1 (2017-04-01)
------------------
 - The previous release (1.4.0) contained an incorrect dependency due to
   bumpversion moving all 1.3.0 versions to 1.4.0. This fixes it.


1.4.0 (2017-04-01)
------------------
 - Hardcode the xml prefix to the xml namespace as defined in the specs (#367)
 - Fix parsing of unbound sequences within xsd choices (#380)
 - Use logger.debug() for debug related logging (#369)
 - Add the ``Client.raw_response`` option to let zeep return the raw
   transport response (requests.Response) instead of trying to parse it.

   in 1.2.0 (#377)


1.2.0 (2017-03-12)

   work with non standard compliant SOAP Servers. See the documentation for
   usage and potential downsides.
 - Minor refactor of resolving of elements for improved performance
 - Support the SOAP 1.2 'http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/'
   transport uri (#355)
 - Fallback to matching wsdl lookups to matching when the target namespace is
   empty (#356)
 - Improve the handling of xsd:includes, the default namespace of the parent
   schema is now also used during resolving of the included schema. (#360)
 - Properly propagate the global flag for complex types when an xsd:restriction
   is used (#360)
 - Filter out duplicate types and elements when dump the wsdl schema (#360)
 - Add ``zeep.CachingClient()`` which enables the SqliteCache by default

 - Update xsd:anyType to return the xml elements when no type is given via the
   xsi:type attribute (#284)
 - Fix parsing Any elements when a restriction is used (soap-enc:array) (#322)


0.26.0 (2017-01-26)
-------------------
This release again introduces some backwords incompatibilties. The next release
will hopefully be 1.0 which will introduce semver.

 - **backwards-incompatible**: The Transport class now accepts a
   ``requests.Session()`` object instead of ``http_auth`` and ``verify``. This
   allows for more flexibility.
 - **backwards-incompatible**: Zeep no longer sets a default cache backend.
   Please see http://docs.python-zeep.org/en/master/transport.html#caching for
   information about how to configure a cache.
 - Add ``zeep.xsd.SkipValue`` which instructs the serialize to ignore the
   element.

 - Fix resolving element/types for xsd schema's with duplicate tns (#319)


0.25.0 (2017-01-23)
-------------------
 - **Important:** Add basic validation against the xsd. It currently will only
   validate the minOccurs/maxOccurs but this will be extended in the future.

   namespaces which were already imported were ignored. It will now search
   through all matching schemas with the tns to find a specific object (#204)
 - Fix xsd:extension for sequence -> choice. (#257)
 - Improve serializing attributes when the values were passed as a dict (#125)


0.24.0 (2016-12-16)

   complexType's (#252)
 - Silently ignore unsupported binding transports instead of an hard error
   (#277)
 - Support microseconds for xsd.dateTime and xsd.Time (#280)
 - Don't mutate passed values to the zeep operations (#280)


0.23.0 (2016-11-24)
-------------------
 - Add Client.set_default_soapheaders() to set soapheaders which are to be used
   on all operations done via the client object.
 - Add basic support for asyncio using aiohttp. Many thanks to chrisimcevoy
   for the initial implementation! Please see
   https://github.com/mvantellingen/python-zeep/pull/207 and
   https://github.com/mvantellingen/python-zeep/pull/251 for more information

-------------------
 - Force the soap:address / http:address to HTTPS when the wsdl is loaded from
   a https url (#228)

   for serializing/deserializing the values. If there is no matching base class
   then the raw value is returned. (#195)
 - Fix handling of xsd:any with maxOccurs > 1 in xsd:choice elements (#253)
 - Add workaround for schema's importing the xsd from
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace (#220)

-------------------
 - Don't error on empty xml namespaces declarations in inline schema's (#186)
 - Wrap importing of sqlite3 in try..except for Google App Engine (#243)

   instead (#243).
 - Fix SOAP arrays by wrapping children in the appropriate element
   (joeribekker, #236)
 - Add ``operation_timeout`` kwarg to the Transport class to set timeouts for
   operations. The default is still no timeout (#140)
 - Introduce client.options context manager to temporarily override various
   options (only timeout for now) (#140)
 - Wrap the parsing of xml values in a try..except block and log an error
   instead of throwing an exception (#137)
 - Fix xsd:choice xml rendering with nested choice/sequence structure (#221)
 - Correctly resolve header elements of which the message part defines the
   type instead of element. (#199)


0.20.0 (2016-10-24)

0.19.0 (2016-10-18)
-------------------
 - **backwards-incompatible**: If the WSDL defines that the endpoint returns
   soap:header elements and/or multple soap:body messages then the return
   signature of the operation is changed. You can now explcitly access the
   body and header elements.
 - Fix parsing HTTP bindings when there are no message elements (#185)
 - Fix deserializing RPC responses (#219
 - Add support for SOAP 1.2 Fault subcodes (#210, vashek)

0.15.0 (2016-09-04)
-------------------
 - All wsdl documents and xsd schemas are now globally available for eachother.
   While this is not correct according to the (messy) soap specifications, it
   does make zeep more compatible with all the invalid wsdl documents out
   there. (#159)
 - Implement support for attributeGroup (#160)
 - Add experimental support for ws-addressing (#92)
 - Fix handling of Mime messages with no parts (#168)
 - Workaround an issue where soap servers don't qualify references (#170)

0.13.0 (2016-07-17)
-------------------
 - Use warnings.warn() for duplicate target namespaces instead of raising an
   exception. This better matches with what lxml does.
 - **backwards-incompatible**: The ``persistent`` kwarg is removed from the
   SqliteCache.__init__() call. Use the new InMemoryCache() instead when you
   don't want to persist data. This was required to make the SqliteCache
   backend thread-safe since we now open/close the db when writing/reading
   from it (with an additional lock).
 - Fix zeep.helpers.serialize_object() for nested objects (#123)
 - Remove fallback between soap 1.1 and soap 1.2 namespaces during the parsing
   of the wsdl. This should not be required.


0.12.0 (2016-07-09)
-------------------
 - **backwards-incompatible**: Choice elements are now unwrapped if
   maxOccurs=1. This results in easier operation definitions when choices are
   used.
 - **backwards-incompatible**: The _soapheader kwarg is renamed to _soapheaders
   and now requires a nested dictionary with the header name as key or a list
   of values (value object or lxml.etree.Element object). Please see the
   call signature of the function using ``python -mzeep <wsdl>``.
 - Support the element ref's to xsd:schema elements.
 - Improve the signature() output of element and type definitions
 - Accept lxml.etree.Element objects as value for Any elements.
 - And various other fixes


0.11.0 (2016-07-03)
-------------------
 - **backwards-incompatible**: The kwarg name for Any and Choice elements are
   renamed to generic ``_value_N`` names.
 - **backwards-incompatible**: Client.set_address() is replaced with the
   Client.create_service() call
 - Auto-load the http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/ schema if it is
   referenced but not imported. Too many XSD's assume that the schema is always
   available.
 - Major refactoring of the XSD handling to correctly support nested
   xsd:sequence elements.
 - Add ``logger.debug()`` calls around Transport.post() to allow capturing the
   content send/received from the server
 - Add proper support for default values on attributes and elements.


0.10.0 (2016-06-22)
-------------------
 - Make global elements / types truly global by refactoring the Schema
   parsing. Previously the lookups where non-transitive, but this should only
   be the case during parsing of the xml schema.
 - Properly unwrap XML responses in soap.DocumentMessage when a choice is the
   root element. (#80)
 - Update exceptions structure, all zeep exceptions are now using
   zeep.exceptions.Error() as base class.
