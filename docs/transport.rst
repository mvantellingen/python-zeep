Transports
==========
If you need to change options like cache, timeout or SSL verification you will
need to create an instance of the Transport class yourself.

SSL verification
----------------
If you need to verficate the SSL connection (in case you have a self signed certificate for your host), the best way is to crea te a :class:`requests.Session` instance and add the information to that Session, so it keeps persistent:

.. code-block:: python

    from requests import Session
    from zeep import Client
    from zeep.transports import Transport

    session = Session()
    session.verify = 'path/to/my/certificate.pem'
    transport = Transport(session=session)
    client = Client(
        'http://my.own.sslhost.local/service?WSDL',
        transport=transport)

.. HINT::
Make sure that the certificate you refer to is a CA_BUNDLE, meaning it contains a root CA and an intermediate CA.
Accepted are only X.509 ASCII files (file extension ``.pem``, sometimes ``crt``). If you have two different files, you must combine them manually into one. 


For instance to **disable SSL verification** (not recommended!) you will need to set the ``verify`` attribute of the :class:`requests.Session` to ``False``. Remember: this should be only done for testing purposes. Python's ``urllib3`` will warn you with a InsecureRequestWarning.

.. code-block:: python

    session = Session()
    session.verify = False


Session timeout
---------------

To set a transport timeout use the `timeout` option. The default timeout is 300
seconds:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeep import Client
    from zeep.transports import Transport

    transport = Transport(timeout=10)
    client = Client(
        'http://www.webservicex.net/ConvertSpeed.asmx?WSDL',
        transport=transport)


.. _transport_caching:

Caching
-------

By default zeep doesn't use a caching backend.  For performance benefits it is
advised to use the SqliteCache backend.  It caches the WSDL and XSD files for
1 hour by default. To use the cache backend init the client with:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeep import Client
    from zeep.cache import SqliteCache
    from zeep.transports import Transport

    transport = Transport(cache=SqliteCache())
    client = Client(
        'http://www.webservicex.net/ConvertSpeed.asmx?WSDL',
        transport=transport)


Changing the SqliteCache settings can be done via:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeep import Client
    from zeep.cache import SqliteCache
    from zeep.transports import Transport
    cache = SqliteCache(path='/tmp/sqlite.db', timeout=60)
    transport = Transport(cache=cache)
    client = Client(
        'http://www.webservicex.net/ConvertSpeed.asmx?WSDL',
        transport=transport)


Another option is to use the InMemoryCache backend.  It internally uses a
global dict to store urls with the corresponding content.


HTTP Authentication
-------------------
While some providers incorporate security features in the header of a SOAP message,
others use the HTTP Authentication header.  In the latter case,
you can just create a :class:`requests.Session` object with the auth set and pass it
to the Transport class.

.. code-block:: python

    from requests import Session
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth  # or HTTPDigestAuth, or OAuth1, etc.
    from zeep import Client
    from zeep.transports import Transport

    session = Session()
    session.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(user, password)
    client = Client('http://my-endpoint.com/production.svc?wsdl',
        transport=Transport(session=session))


.. _debugging:

Debugging
---------
To see the SOAP XML messages which are sent to the remote server and the
response received you can set the Python logger level to DEBUG for the
``zeep.transports`` module. Since 0.15 this can also be achieved via the
:ref:`plugin-history`.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging.config

    logging.config.dictConfig({
        'version': 1,
        'formatters': {
            'verbose': {
                'format': '%(name)s: %(message)s'
            }
        },
        'handlers': {
            'console': {
                'level': 'DEBUG',
                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
                'formatter': 'verbose',
            },
        },
        'loggers': {
            'zeep.transports': {
                'level': 'DEBUG',
                'propagate': True,
                'handlers': ['console'],
            },
        }
    })
